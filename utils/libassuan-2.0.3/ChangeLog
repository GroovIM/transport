2011-12-13  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	Fix assuan_get_pid for pipe servers.
	At some point in the past we introduced a regression in that the
	client of a pipe server received its own pid and not the pid of
	the server.

	* src/assuan-pipe-connect.c (struct at_pipe_fork)
	(struct at_socketpair_fork): Add PARENT_PID.
	(at_pipe_fork_cb, at_socketpair_fork): Use PARENT_PID instead of getpid.
	(pipe_connect, socketpair_connect): Set PARENT_PID.

	vasprintf.c: Improve test code.
	* src/vasprintf.c (checkit): Set flag for a test failure.
	(main): Return error on any failure.
